## Maths

This repo contains two files:

- `index.js`: this contains a broken 'maths' function which is supposed to do maths, by taking in 2 numbers and a string. It is broken. Was made to publish to `npm` so Code Academy students can import and then test, whilst having the source code obscured.

- `scope.js`: examples of scoping issues in javascript
